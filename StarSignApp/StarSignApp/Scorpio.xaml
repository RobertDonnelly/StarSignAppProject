Passionate, exacting, loves extremes, combative, reflective.

                   &#10;
             The Scorpio's symbol is the Scorpion, and that is no accident. Much like the Scorpion would rather kill itself than be killed, &#10;
             those born under this sign are in ultimate control of their destiny. &#10;
             It is life on the Scorpion's terms, too, since these folks promote their agenda and see to it that things go forward. &#10;
             Others may find this overbearing (it can be) and even self-destructive, &#10;
             but that's the beauty of the Scorpio sign: They have tremendous regenerative powers, &#10;
             much like the literal Scorpion can lose its tail and promptly grow a new one. &#10;
                   &#10;
             Scorpions don't miss much, since they are highly attuned to the vibrations of others. &#10;
             They are intuitive, probing and very focused on knowing who's who and what's what. &#10;
             Scorpios can lose their temper (and even become vengeful) when someone gets in their way, &#10;
             so it's best to give them plenty of room. Remember, &#10;
             they're unafraid, and a loss today simply means an opportunity for victory tomorrow.&#10;
                  &#10;
             Finally, while Scorpios aren't above some subtle manipulation to get what they want, &#10;
             they'd much rather take a scientific, even mystical path. &#10;
             The Scorpio personality is powerful and passionate, traits that serve them well, &#10;
             as long as they don't let them deteriorate into self-indulgence or compulsion.&#10;"
