             Chief among the traits of a Leo is their fierce need for self-expression. &#10;
             A Leo has a strong personality and a desire to take the stage (both literally and proverbially). &#10;
             They are proud and will wear their heart on their sleeve, but can often get swept away in personal theatrics. &#10; 
             A Leo can upstage others, forgetting that each and every person is a valuable member to a team. &#10;
             Yet, a Leo's flair for powerful leadership can also let everyone have their spot in the sunshine. &#10;
             Leo is the sign of the hopeless romantic. As the zodiac's fifth sign, Leo loves to be the center of attention. &#10;
             &#10;
             Positive Leo astrology traits include being courageous, kind, generous, loyal, protective, nakedly honest and entertaining. &#10;
             They're not afraid to let their true essence shine in the Sun, which is also their planetary ruler. &#10;
             Leo energy leaves others feeling awakened and revitalized in an empowering way. &#10;
             &#10;
             Difficult traits of the Leo sign include being greedy, sloppy, coldhearted, jealous, aggressive and vain. &#10;
             Leo is a loyal fixed sign and an extroverted fire sign. But as the fifth sign of the zodiac, Leo can also be overbearing. &#10;
             Leo may have a tendency to step on some toes and get a little overzealous, even pissing people off with their bossy demeanor. &#10;
             But they are also natural born leaders who take extreme pride in their talents and beliefs. &#10;"
