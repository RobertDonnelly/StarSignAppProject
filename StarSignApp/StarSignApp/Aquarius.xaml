            <Label Text=" Aquarius-born are shy and quiet , but on the other hand they can be eccentric and energetic.&#10;
 However, in both cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others. &#10; 
 They are able to see without prejudice, on both sides, which makes them people who can easily solve problems. &#10;  
 Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius-born have a deep need to be some time alone and away from everything, in order to restore power.&#10; 
 People born under the Aquarius sign, look at the world as a place full of possibilities."
