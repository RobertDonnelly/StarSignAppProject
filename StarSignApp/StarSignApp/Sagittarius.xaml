Happy, absent minded, creative, adventurous.&#10;
                   &#10;
                   &#10;
             Sagittarians crave the freedom of the open road, both metaphorically and physically. &#10; 
             They are most unhappy when they are tied to a normal routine &#10;
             and can become restless in situations where there is not enough variety involved. &#10; 
             Because they travel so much and are eager to experience new things, &#10;
             those of this sign are fun to be around and often have large numbers of friends. &#10;
             They question everything and think that everyone should do the same. &#10;
             &#10;
             Sagittarius is open-hearted, generous, and big-spirited, but Sagittarius is always truthful. &#10;
             Because of this, they may hurt others' feelings, or may be called out for not having tact or empathy. &#10;
             The latter is not true. With their keen imagination, &#10;
             Sagittarius is adept at putting themselves in another person's shoes—that's why so many &#10;
             are successful actors—but they do not feel the need to beat around the bush or lie. &#10;
             You can trust a Sagittarius to tell you what they really think. You can also trust a Sagittarius, period. &#10;
             Unlike other signs, they won't spill any secrets.&#10;"
