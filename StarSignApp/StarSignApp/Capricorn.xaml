            <Label Text="Smart, hardworking, and fully in control of their destiny, a Capricorn will always get what they set their mind to, &#10;
             in both personal and professional life—no excuses. Capricorns may get a reputation as stubborn, &#10;
             but they simply know what they want, and also know how they wish other people would behave.&#10;
&#10;
Natural rule-followers, Capricorns thrive on order and love strict rules, hierarchies, and set ways to do things. &#10;
             Can a Capricorn think outside the box? Yes, they can, but they prefer when they have strict boundaries to constrain against—free reign can make them feel paralyzed by choice. &#10;
             Capricorns are great at climbing the corporate ladder, and especially adept at making (and investing) money. &#10;
             Capricorns love family, and put a lot of stock in traditions. &#10;
             A Capricorn might stress themselves out trying to do everything perfectly—a Capricorn may feel like they must present a home-cooked meal every day, &#10;
             and would never admit to doing drive-thru or takeout. &#10;
             Capricorns believe presentation is everything, and their homes are usually Insta-worthy. &#10;
             A Capricorn sometimes is overly focused on what things look like, instead of how things feel, &#10;
             which could cause them to feel stifled and unhappy.&#10;
&#10;
Capricorn needs to find a firm sense of self beyond how others perceive them, &#10;
             and recognize that racking up achievements is only one small part of their personality.&#10;
&#10;
Capricorns are loyal friends, and have a funny and sly sense of humor when you get to know them—it is fun drawing them out of their shells. &#10;
             In love, Capricorn is a true partner, who is laser-focused on helping their partner find success and happiness. &#10;
             A Capricorn will dive into a relationship like a job, and believes that hard work can help make a bond as strong as possible. &#10;
             While sometimes a romantic conversation may veer toward feeling a bit like a board meeting, &#10;
             especially with action items and improvement plans, but if you roll with it, they have a point: Your bond will be stronger.&#10;"
