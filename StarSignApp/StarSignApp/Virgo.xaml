             Smart, sophisticated, and kind, Virgo gets the job done without complaining. Virgos are amazing friends, &#10;
             always there to lend a hand and also lend advice. Practical Virgos are incredibly adept at big picture thinking, &#10;
             and planning out their life, their vacations, and what they're going to do today isn't a drag it makes them feel in control and secure. &#10;
             &#10;
             Virgo has a rich inner life, and can sometimes seem shy at first meeting. A Virgo won't spill secrets right away, &#10;
             and it's important to earn a Virgo's trust. But once you do, that Virgin will be a friend for life. &#10;
             And if you think that you're dating a shy Virgo, trust that those walls will fall down in the bedroom. &#10;
             One of the most passionate signs, Virgos specialize at connecting to their physicality, &#10;
             and this earth sign loves and celebrates physical connection with their partner. &#10;
             &#10;
             Virgos expect perfection from themselves, and they may project those high standards on the other people in their life. &#10;
             A Virgo hates when someone lets him or her down, even if it's minor and unavoidable, like a last-minute cancellation. &#10;
             Virgos never want to disappoint the people in their lives, so they may spread themselves too thin put themselves last. &#10;"
