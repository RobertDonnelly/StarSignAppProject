                <Label Text="Energetic and quick-witted, Gemini never gets stuck in the past and doesn't ruminate on what might have been. &#10;
                 Instead, they move forward with glass-half-full optimism and an ability to always look on the bright side—and land on their feet—in nearly any situation. &#10; 
                 With a mind that's constantly racing, even when they're just quietly hanging out, the Twins never get bored. &#10;
                 In fact, Gemini are happy keeping their own company, and can often turn their solitary daydreams into reality. &#10;
                 Despite their unfair rep for being two-faced, once a Gemini is in your life, &#10;
                 they're loyal for life—but they aren't afraid to voice their opinion if they feel you're doing something they disagree with or if they perceive you as not being loyal to them. &#10;
                 Always a sign to see all sides of the situation, Gemini may seek input from friends before going to the root of the problem. &#10;"
