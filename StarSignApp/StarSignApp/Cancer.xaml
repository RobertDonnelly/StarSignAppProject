             Most Cancers have been called psychic at some point, and with good reason—Cancer can often intuit relationships, &#10;
             ideas, and motivations before anyone has actually spoken. That can make for challenging interactions with this sign—Cancer hates small talk, &#10; 
             especially when it contains white lies (like saying, 'How nice to see you!' when it's clear that both parties would rather avoid each other). &#10;
             That's why social gatherings can be overwhelming for Cancers. They'd much rather spend time in small groups where everyone is on the same page.&#10;
             &#10;
             Cancer loves creating and needs some type of creative outlet, whether it's painting, writing, or even just reading. &#10;
             Cancer also loves connecting to a higher power, and may find comfort in religion or spiritual practices. &#10;
             Even though Crabs can be intense, they also have a funny side with a wry sense of humor, &#10;
             and they're adept at observing and mimicking people around them. &#10;"
